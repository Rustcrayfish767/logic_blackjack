Welcome to the tops casino. our slot machines are down and someone stole the roulette wheel so all we got is blackjack.

suppose i should tell you how to play huh. cant rob you if you dont start eh.

normal blackjack you get 1 hand and try to get to 21 without going over

the game we play here is called black jack switch, its similer to blackjack just with a new twist.
in this game you get 2 hands and the "switch" part of the name comes from being able to switch the top 2 cards of you hands 
allowing you to get closer to 21.

the tops has its own house rule. if the player wants to they can swap hands with the dealer. they dont see it though as to 
let the house win some times lol, this also triples the bet so its entirly optional 

good luck and have fun at the tops
